For incorporating advanced features like state estimation and mapping, Raisin supports the use of plugins. These plugins are dynamically loaded and the ``advance()`` function is called periodically according to the specified frequency (Hz). There are three methods to load a plugin:

#. Load by ``raisin_raibo2_node``: This method loads the plugin from the start of the executable.

#. Load by ``controller``: This method loads the plugin concurrently when the controller is loaded.

#. Load by ``plugin``: This method loads other plugin concurrently when the plugin is loaded.

To load a plugin, details such as the plugin name and the desired frequency of updates must be specified in the params.yaml file located under the ``config`` directory of the package. Hereâ€™s how you can declare it in the ``params.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: xml

  plugin:
    raisin_foo: # plugin package name
      rate:
        value: 200 # loop frequency
        dtype: double
    raisin_bar:
      rate:
        value: 300
        dtype: double

In this configuration:

* **name**: Specifies the unique identifier or name of the plugin.
* **frequency**: Specifies how often, in Hertz (Hz), the ``advance()`` function of the plugin should be called.

A plugin stores its subscribers, which are packages(can be ``raibo_node``, ``controller``, and ``plugin``) that configured the plugin.
A plugin is unloaded if

#. There's no subscriber anymore

#. Another plugin with same pluginType is loaded(refer to the ``PluginType``)

For implementing plugins in Raisin, it's important to adhere to the naming convention specified. Each plugin should be named following the pattern ``raisin_**_plugin``, where ** represents a descriptive part of the plugin's functionality. 

For practical implementation examples, refer to the :download:`raisin_example_plugin.zip <../example/raisin_example_plugin.zip>`.
