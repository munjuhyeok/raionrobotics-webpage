Run
***********************************************

These commands can also be executed using the ``raisin_gui``

Run In simulation
======================
Open a new terminal, navigate to ``raisin_ws``, and source the setup files:

.. code-block:: bash

  source install/setup.bash

Now run the ``raisin_raibo2`` node:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 run raisin_raibo2 raisin_raibo2_node

.. You can visualize it using `raisimUnity`.

Run in real robot
======================
Open a new terminal, navigate to `raisin_ws`, and source the setup files:

.. code-block:: bash

  source install/setup.bash

Now run the `raisin_raibo2` node:

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 run raisin_raibo2 raisin_raibo2_node real

This node primarily facilitates communication between ``worldHub_`` and other components.

Initially, it initiates communication based on settings from the configuration YAML file ``$raisin_ws/install/raisin_raibo2/share/raisin_raibo2/params.yaml``.
Ensure that the ``camera`` is properly configured, including settings for ``use_depth`` and ``use_rgb``, and ``serial_number``. This configuration is essential for the camera to function correctly according to your requirements.
If a sensor is not connected on a real robot, make sure to set ``use_sensor`` false, otherwise the robot will not operate.

It subscribes to the topic ``raisin/joy``, which is published by a user, to receive desired velocity inputs.
Additionally, by subscribing to the service ``raibo/load_controller``, you can load a new controller and unload an existing one.

The node also publishes several topics and logs data for further analysis and debugging.
