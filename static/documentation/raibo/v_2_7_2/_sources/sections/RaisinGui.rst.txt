Introduction

Raisin Gui is a modular GUI framework for raisin.
When the executable runs, it loads all libraries prefixed ``raisin_gui_`` and suffixed ``_window``.
The loaded windows can be launched from the menu bar, or you can launch them from the start.
You can change these settings in the config file.

You can easily create your own gui window.
Raisin Gui is based on ImGui, a popular immediate gui library.
Watch the following video to see how you can create your own gui window.
